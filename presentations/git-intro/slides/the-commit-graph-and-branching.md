##  The Commit Graph and Branching

TBD

note:
    * The graph is the visualization of the commit chain
        * `git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all`
    * Branching in Git is simply creating a new pointer at a specific snapshot
        * This means that branches do not diverge until you make a commit on that branch
