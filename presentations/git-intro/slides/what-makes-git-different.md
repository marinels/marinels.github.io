##  What Makes Git Different?

* No more requirement of a single central server
* Ability to *rewrite* commit history
* Eliminated issue where a developer *cannot commit* their changes

note:
    Committing changes is always possible because you only ever commit to the local repository. Now pushing changes becomes the gateway. But this means the developer can **always** version their changes, just maybe not push them up centrally. This is a much safer practice to versioning changes.
