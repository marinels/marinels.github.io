##  What Makes Git Different?

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> No more requirement of a single central server
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Ability to ***rewrite*** commit history
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Eliminates the issue where a developer *cannot commit* their changes due to conflicts from someone else's commits

note:
    Committing changes is always possible because you only ever commit to the local repository. Now pushing changes becomes the gateway. But this means the developer can **always** version their changes, just maybe not push them up centrally. This is a much safer practice to versioning changes.
