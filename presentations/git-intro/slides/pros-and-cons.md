##  Pros and Cons

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> **PRO**: Git is very powerful because it allows very fine grained control over versioning
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> **PRO**: Git has a massive user base and is used by many (large and small) tech companies
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> **CON**: Git's complex nature and steep (but short) learning curve can deter motivation
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> **CON**: Git stores all snapshots in its local database (can grow *very large*)

note:
  Git-LFS exists to deal with large files

  Git is built on many small (command line) utilities that do one job really well
