##  Pros and Cons

TBD

note:
    * Git is a very powerful system, it is widely used and accepted as the standard for version control
    * Git is built on many small (command line) utilities that do one job really well
    * Git struggles with many large files (it is well known it does not work well for game development)
        * This has been addressed to some extent with the Git-LFS extension
