##  Local vs Remote

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Always one local repository
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Zero or more remote repositories
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Local repositories can ***sync*** with any remote repository on demand

---

## Your Own Local Repository

* Git keeps a local copy of the entire repository that you control
* Git keeps a historical record of any commit you've made (for about 2 weeks)
* Local repository is essentially a collection of file system snapshots

---

## Add a Remote to Sync With

* Use a remote repository to sync your changes up and others' changes down
* Track any number of remote repositories
* Create local branches that track remote branches

---

## Sync on Your Schedule

* Choose to sync when it's convenient for you
* Syncing doesn't interfere with your commit workflow
* Avoid dealing with conflicts until you're ready

note:
  Creating local repositories is simple. Push to a remote like Github or Bitbucket (or both) by adding a remote.
